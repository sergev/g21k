Make binary RPM package

There is a problem in generation of a map file. There is now a guard for
that problem, see link/output.c. This may be a bug in the original AD 
tools for symbols of classes C_NULL and C_AUTO not detected in the Windows
runtime environment, but it should be investigated.

Some minor issues:
	Handle standard filenames like "\\21k\\lib\\"
	Handle other standard stuff like getenv( "ADII_21K");

Making the binutils more portable (32 bit vz. 64 bit)

Making the emulator in the non-GUI mode work.

Adapting the emulator in the GUI mode, under X and GTK or similar.

Adapting the debugger in the GUI mode, under X and GTK or similar.

Making a device driver for the JTAG probe.
