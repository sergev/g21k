This is the binary utilities (assembler, linker) based on the debugger 
and related sources published by Analog Devices for their 21k/Sharc DSP,
with adaptations and patches for Unices. The original source code can be
found at:

    ftp://ftp.analog.com/pub/dsp/dev_tool/21k_tool/gnu_src/sharcdebug.zip


IMPORTANT NOTES

This tarball only contains those parts of the source code required for the
binutils. The debugger/emulator requires much more work. Please refer to
the original AD zip file if a full set of files is required.

Although these tools are from the stable AD release, but have been patched
for use with Unices.

The source code as provided is not very portable. It has been tested on 
Linux and Intel x86, and may well work on other 32-bit CPUs.
On other architectures, further work is probably required. It will not
work on 64-bit (Alpha), for instance.

Major changes compared to the original AD release:

    PL4
	Fixes from Jouni Ryno <jouni.ryno@fmi.fi> and Gregory
	McGarry <g.mcgarry@ieee.org> re. packing of structures used
	for external file formats.

	Fixes from Jouni Ryno <jouni.ryno@fmi.fi> re. multiple 
	file closes and related memory corruption.

	Fix based on observation by Jouni Ryno <jouni.ryno@fmi.fi> re.
	a bug in the assembler preprocessor redefinition warning
	mechanism.

    PL3
	Added GPL message to the copyright statement.

	Introduced rudimentary man pages.

	Made RPM package.

    PL2
	Introduced autoconf - should handle endianness and more.

	Cleaned up fix for GCC structure sizeof by specifying packed
	structures.

    PL1
	Made makefiles, since there were noen suitable for Unices

	Introduced -DCSCAPE for Cscape GUI on sun (which may be pretty
	obsolete, anyway). In addition, we already have -DWIN31 for
	Windows 3.1.

	Many thanks to Peter Berg <root@line1.slipneu.tu-freiberg.de> for
	doing the debugging of the COFF structure sizeof problem with
	gcc. My current fix for this problem is ugly as sin, but should
	work.

	Moved local time string stuff to util.c

	Added guard and fatal error traps in link/output.c

	Implemented reasonable default for ADI_DSP environment variable,
	so that we normally don't have to set it in our environment. It can
	explicitly be set to "" if this feature is not desired.

	Cleaned up support for various architectures somewhat.
