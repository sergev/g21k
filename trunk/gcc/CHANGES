3.3.4PL2
	Fixed a cc1 core dump situation in g21k/reload.c


3.3.4PL1
	Merged version 3.3.4 from AD.


3.3.1PL3
	Added the old and "safe" 21xx version to a seperate source tree.

	Added a main Makefile.

	Added support for various other host machines (m68k, vax etc), 
	taken from the original GCC 2.3.3 distribution.

	Identical files have been replaced by symbolic links in the 
	interest of reducing the size of the distribution, as well as
	being an aid for possible future integration.

	Removed some stuff relating to C++ plus some orig-files in the
	interest of decreasing the size of the distribution.


3.3.1PL2
	A couple of adjustments for the glibc was required.

	A man-page for g21k has been prepared.

	The distribution was made by "make realclean".


3.3.1PL1
	A few small changes has been made, as indicated below. The original
	files have been left intact with an .orig suffix, and most changes has
	been marked by *EK*.

	A number of fixes concerning the Linux host configuration.

	The adi_dsp tree contains some sample 21k architecture files -
	an essential part of g21k.

	Introduced g21k/patchlevel.h (PLx).

	In the interest of keeping the distribution small, files for
	targetting other processors than the AD DSPs has been removed.
	They serve no useful purpose here, anyway. Similarily, the original
	changelogs for GCC 2.3.3 has been removed - they were unchanged
	from the GCC distribution - and archeologists will find them there.
