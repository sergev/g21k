/* This file defines all the MACHINE MODES used by GNU CC.

   A machine mode specifies a size and format of data
   at the machine level.

   Each RTL expression has a machine mode.

   At the syntax tree level, each ..._TYPE and each ..._DECL node
   has a machine mode which describes data of that type or the
   data of the variable declared.  */

/* The first argument is the internal name of the machine mode
   used in the C source.
   By convention these are in UPPER_CASE, except for the word  "mode".

   The second argument  is the name of the machine mode in the
   external ASCII format used for reading and printing RTL and trees.
   By convention these names in UPPER_CASE.

   Third argument states the kind of representation:
   MODE_INT - integer
   MODE_FLOAT - floating
   MODE_PARTIAL_INT - PSImode and PDImode
   MODE_CC - modes used for representing the condition code in a register
   MODE_COMPLEX_INT, MODE_COMPLEX_FLOAT - complex number
   MODE_RANDOM - anything else

   Fourth argument is the relative size of the object, in bytes.
   It is zero when the size is meaningless or not determined.
   A byte's size is determined by BITS_PER_UNIT in tm.h. 


   Fifth arg is the relative size of subunits of the object.
   It is same as the fourth argument except for complexes,
   since they are really made of two equal size subunits.

   Sixth arg is next wider natural mode of the same class.
   0 if there is none.  */
