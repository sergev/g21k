.PP
The assembler ignores the rest of
.B any
line following an exclamation mark (\fB!\fP). This
means that if you have a \fB!\fP inside an assembler comment (ie. comment
enclosed in \fB{\fP and \fB}\fP) then the closing \fB}\fP will not be
processed and the following lines of code will be silently ignored
until the next \fB}\fP is encountered.
