This is the source code for GCC for the Analog Devices Sharc DSP,
essentially as distributed on the AD ftp site:

    ftp://ftp.analog.com/pub/dsp/dev_tool/21k_tool/gnu_src/g21k-3.3-src.tar.Z

In addition, a release for the DSP 21xx has been included, presently
not available from AD, but from:

    ftp://ftp.dgii.com/users/rick/g21xx.tar.gz

These compilers are all based on the GCC version 2.3.3


HOSTS

This version has currently only been tested under Linux/i386. Since all
GCC host configuration files have been included, it will probably work
under most other Unixes with no or minimum work. You probably cannot 
build a cross compiler on a Vax, however, since it uses a non standard 
float format.

To compile you will need, in addition to a good C compiler, various
GNU tools like gperf and bison.

Altough it is believed that the compilers are all right, they really have
NOT been verified for correctness.


WHAT IS MISSING

Please also note that this is only the compiler. It can be useful enough
for those who already posess an assembler and a linker. But for all others,
many essential parts of a useful DSP development system are still missing:

    a.  An assembler (a21000 for the Sharc/21k, a21c for 21csp,
	asm2 for 21xx).
    b.  Linker/librarian.
    c.  C library.
    d.  Debugger.

This is now being remedied.

WRT a C library, the AD C library may or may not be available for public
use - I have not yet been able to establish the exact status.

WRT a debugger, the AD Sharc debugger source code will soon be made
available on the AD FTP site, ftp.analog.com.

For the Analog Devices ADSP-2181 EZ-Kit Lite DSP evaluation board, a 
complete host download/support package for Unix/Linux, plus some
sample 2181 DSP source code, can be found on the AD ftp site:

	ftp://ftp.analog.com/public/dsp/ezkitlt/ezkit_unix_1.6.tar.Z



DOCUMENTATION

The only documentation included in this package is a g21k/g21/g21c man 
page, in addition to the standard GNU man pages.
